        <li>Stretch Goal #7 / Loops Practical Video<br>
          I don't quite understand the difference between the 'for in' and 'for of' Loops.
          Aren't they doing the same thing? For example in the video with hand of cards...both Loops
          are checking every card, right? Just don't quite understand why you'd wanna make up 
          another variable in this instance.
